# CKAN Connect

CKAN connect is a [Drupal 8/9/10](https://www.drupal.org/project/ckan_connect) companion module for the
[Data Visualisation Framework (DVF)](https://github.com/govCMS/dvf) module. Its goal is to provide
[CKAN](https://ckan.org/) connectivity and abstract API calls. Other modules can use CKAN connect
if they need CKAN connectivity from Drupal and it does not require DVF to function.

CKAN is the industry standard for large dataset storage and is used by most governments for public
data storage. It provides a robust API for retrieving data records with support for filtering,
searching and more.

Examples of CKAN instances:
* [data.gov.au](https://data.gov.au/)
* [data.nsw.gov.au](https://data.nsw.gov.au/)
* [data.gov](https://data.gov/)
* [data.gov.uk](https://data.gov.uk/)

## Install and configure

### Install
CKAN connect is ideally installed via composer
```
composer require drupal/ckan_connect
```
Then enabled via Drupal UI or drush
```
drush en ckan_connect
```

### Configure

Once installed you must set the Base URL for the CKAN instance.

* Visit: Admin > Configuration > Webservices > CKAN Connect (`/admin/config/services/ckan-connect`)
* Set the API url to match your CKAN instance eg. `https://data.gov.au/api/3`
* If you need write access to CKAN or you need to view private datasets then you can also
  add an API key. Note the security implications here, you could potentially expose private
  data on your Drupal site when an API key is used.

## CKAN Connect API

### Add as dependency

If your module requires CKAN Connect, ensure dependencies are added

#### composer.json
```json
"require": {
    "drupal/ckan_connect": "*"
}
```

#### module.info.yml
```yml
dependencies:
  - ckan_connect:ckan_connect
```

### Usage

The [CkanClientInterface](https://github.com/govCMS/ckan_connect/blob/8.x-1.x/src/Client/CkanClientInterface.php)
documents available methods, but most of the time you will only need the `get()` method. This
will make an API call to a specific endpoint with the appropriate query parameters added.

Example of querying the `action/datastore_search` endpoint:

```php
use Drupal\ckan_connect\Client\CkanClientInterface;

$client = new CkanClientInterface();

$response = $client->get('action/datastore_search', [
  'id' => 'da675507-10b5-4825-8e79-09dcbb577ece',
  'limit' => 10,
  'offset' => 0,
]);

if ($response->success === TRUE) {
  var_dump($response->result);
}
```

View the [CKAN API docs](https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/api/) for more information on available endpoints
and query parameters.

## Running Test
Refer to instructions on [Running PHPUnit tests](https://www.drupal.org/docs/automated-testing/phpunit-in-drupal/running-phpunit-tests) from the official Drupal documentation.
All dvf tests belong to the group ckan_connect so you can run all tests locally using something like

```
vendor/bin/phpunit --group=ckan_connect
```
### Running a specific Test function
To limit tests to a unique function run something like:
```
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=ckan_connect --filter=testParserDoesNotRecognizeInvalidUrls
```
